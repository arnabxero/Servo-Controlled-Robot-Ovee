- Idle Sensor Value is Base Pressure (p0) value,
- Grab and Stopped Position Sensor Value is the Peak Pressure (p1) value,
- Delta Pressure (dp) is the difference between Peak and Base Pressure values abs(p1 - p0).
- First Variable for equation is (dp)
- In this case whatever the pressure reading is calculated is actually delta pressure because the pressure starts from zero.
------------------------------------------------
- We have preset deforamation value 1 mm in g.py
- sqrt(deformation_in_mm) is the second variable for equation
------------------------------------------------
================================================
- Need to find the slope of (dp) and sqrt(deformation_in_mm) in calculations.py with a new function
================================================
- Convert the sensor value into pressure by multiplying raw sensor value by 8.61

Hey, I need some changes in the graphs.

In the first subplot, I need to show:

Live pressure reading (which i believe already there)

Then I need to add another value in this same subplot alongside live pressure which is deformation_in_mm. Now here's some tricky part, deformation is hardcoded as 1mm which is fine. But we need to show this 1 mm deformation in respect to time similar to pressure. Now we already know that what is the sensor idle value and also what is the gap between jaws in mm by the diameter_in_mm. As the jaw starts closing, at some point it will touch the object inside it and that object will start to increase the pressure in the pressure sensor. We set a touch value for sensor which means if the live sensor value = sensor idle value + sensor touch value, meaning the object is touched. And from that moment it will start the deformation process which closes the jaw a little more after the first touch. Meaning if the diameter_in_mm was 20 in first touch, the jaw will still keep closing until it is 20+deformation_in_mm = 21. Now here's what we need to show - for the entire time, the deformation we will keep showing 0 as deformation in mm. But as soon as it starts deforming after touch is triggered, it will keep showing how this 1mm deformation is happening in respect to time.

Now as we need to show pressure kpa and deformation mm in same graph, use the secondary y axis to present the mm scale and primary y axis to present the kpa scale. x axis will be time as usual.

And change the second subplot from showing diameter to showing the slope between current live pressure and sqrt(deformation_in_mm) against time and keep showing in real time in the second subplot.
